# Aub SIS New Grade Alert
This python script checks if a new grade was posted on the student's dashboard, by checking the number of credits every 30 mins.
It would then go on to send a notification to the phone of the user, every time a grade was released.
(Used to work before the introduction of 2FA to the institution)
